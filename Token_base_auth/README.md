# Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (or JWTs) provide a means of transmitting information from the client to the server in a stateless, secure way.

On the server, JWTs are generated by signing user information via a secret key, which are then securely stored on the client. This form of auth works well with modern, single page applications. For more on this, along with the pros and cons of using JWTs vs. session and cookie-based auth, please review the following articles:


# Getting Started
## JWT Setup

#### The auth workflow works as follows:

    1. Client provides email and password, which is sent to the server
    2. Server then verifies that email and password are correct and responds with an auth token
    3. Client stores the token and sends it along with all subsequent requests to the API
    4. Server decodes the token and validates it

#### This cycle repeats until the token expires or is revoked. In the latter case, the server issues a new token.

#### The tokens themselves are divided into three parts:

    1. Header
    2. Payload
    3. Signature


## Project Setup

1. Start by downloading the project flash-jwt-auth
2. cd into the folder(cd flash-jwt-auth)
3. Create and activate a virtualenv and install the dependencies
```sh
$ python3.6 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Create DB
Create the databases in psql:
```sh
$ psql
# create database flask_jwt_auth
# create database flask_jwt_auth_test
# \q
```

### Create the tables and run the migrations:
```sh
$ python manage.py create_db
$ python manage.py db init
$ python manage.py db migrate
```
# Run the Application
```sh
$ python manage.py runserver
```
Access the application at the address http://localhost:5000/

## Testing
### Without coverage:
```sh
$ python manage.py test
```
### With coverage:
```sh
$ python manage.py cov
```
